# Iftm.ComputedProperties

This project enables _automagic_ firing of [PropertyChanged][1] events. It's perfect for view models.

## NuGet

The binaries from this repository are available as the [Iftm.ComputedProperties](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Iftm.ComputedProperties/) NuGet packge.

## Example

Say you have a property A, and a property B that is evaluated as A + 5. To have the [PropertyChanged][1] event fired for both A and B whenever A changes, simply inherit from WithComputedProperties like this:

```C#
using Iftm.ComputedProperties;

class Demo : WithComputedProperties
{
    private int _a; // value of A

    public int A {
        get => _a;
        set => SetProperty(ref _a, value); 
    }

    // Describe our computation for B using an expression:
    private static readonly ComputedProperty<Demo, int> _b =
        Computed((Demo obj) => obj.A + 5);

    // Implement a property that evaluates _b:
    public int B => _b.Eval(this);
}
```
The magic of this is that whenever A changes, the [PropertyChanged][1] event will be fired for both A and B.

This also works for property chains like a.B.C.D where a, B and C are objects, the property computation is a conditional expressions, etc.

## Lifetime

In case object A has properties that depend on object B, the whenever anybody is subscribed to A's [PropertyChanged][1] event A will also subscribe to B's [PropertyChanged][1]. When A has no more listeners it will disconnect from B.

You can (but don't have to) also call [Dispose()][2] on the model above which will disconnect it from all the input events and clear its [PropertyChanged][1] event. Frameworks like [WPF](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf) use the weak event pattern to disconnect from events but explicitly disposing the model should yield better performance and provide for better debuggability.

## Expensive Properties

In case the computation of a property is expensive (perhaps it allocates?), it makes sense to cache the value of the property computation and use it in subsequent evaluations if the property has not been changed. 

To do this simply inherit your model from WithCachedProperties, declare the variable that will contain the cached value if any, and use it in the call to Eval:

```C#
using Iftm.ComputedProperties;

class Demo : WithCachedProperties {
    private string _a;

    public string A {
        get => _a;
        set => SetProperty(ref _a, value); 
    }

    private static readonly ComputedProperty<Demo, string> _b =
        Computed((Demo obj) => obj.A + " blah blah.");

    private string _lastB;

    public string B => _b.Eval(this, ref _lastB);
}
```

## Tasks

In case the value of a property depends on an asynchronous I/O or computation, we provide the TaskModel class that wraps a function CancellationToken â†’ ValueTask&lt;T&gt;. When [PropertyChanged][1] listeners are attached to objects of this class, it calls the provided function to get the property value. If all listeners are detached before the task completes, it cancels the call and then repeats it again if listeners are added later.

The two properties TaskModel&lt;T&gt; are Value, which returns the value of the task if it's been completed, and HasValue which tells us whether the task has been completed. HasValue is useful for displaying a progress indication and for knowing whether Value can be successfully read.

Here is an example:

```C#
using Iftm.ComputedProperties;

class Demo : WithCachedProperties {
    private int _a;

    public int A {
        get => _a;
        set => SetProperty(ref _a, value);
    }

    private async static ValueTask<int> AsyncFunction(int num, CancellationToken ct) {
        await Task.Delay(2_000, ct);
        return num + 1;
    }

    private ComputedProperty<Demo, TaskModel<int>> _b =>
        Computed((Demo obj) => TaskModel.Create(obj.A, AsyncFunction));

    private TaskModel<int> _lastB;

    public TaskModel<int> B => _b.Eval(this, ref _lastB);
}
```
Please note that the computation of _b reads the value of the property A and passes it to the AsyncFunction as an argument. This is necessary as the AsyncFunction will execute asynchronously so it would be impossible to determine the dependency chain if it read the properties of our object directly.

## Performance

The Iftm.ComputedProperties package is ridiculously efficient. Although it tracks property dependencies at runtime (because in case of A.B.C the object A needs to know when B changes so that it can unsubscribe from the old B and subscribe to the new one), the memory usage is miniscule and cache-friendly, and the CPU usage is negligible. If you are binding to these objects in any UI framework like UWP or WPF you will not feel it and your code will definitely be more robust and simpler.

Iftm.ComputedProperties blows frameworks like [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net) out of the water both in performance and simplicity. Everything is stored inside the single object instead of spawning tens of Observables in order to do simple computations.
